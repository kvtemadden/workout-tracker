## Functionality
Upon landing on the workout tracker landing page, a user is prompted to add a "new exercise" if they haven't already got history of exercises.

The user then needs to fill out information on whether their exercise is cardio or resistence, which they can then add to their last workout or create a new one.

Upon submitting the information, the graphs on their dashboard will populate with 7 day information based on their workouts.

On the left they'll be able to see a line graph of their workout durations, on the right they'll be able to see the weight in lbs lifted.

This will allow users to compare their fitness workouts across the seven day period.
